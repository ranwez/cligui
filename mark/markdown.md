# Sequences alignment

**{{mark/option01}}**

The **alignSequences** program will read and align a FASTA file, here is a basic example of its usage :

* *{{mark/option02}}*

In the above example, MACSE will read **sequences.fasta** and create a nucleotides alignment in **sequences_NT.fasta**
and an amino acids alignment in **sequences_AA.fasta**.

The **seq** option just needs a FASTA file, being aligned or not.
